# 🧠 Machine
### Human-in-the-Loop AI Workspace for Data & Knowledge Exploration

machine is a lightweight Flask web application that provides a browser-based workspace for experimenting with data labeling, knowledge organization, and AI-assisted insight generation.

This project is intentionally simple and modular — designed as a foundation for building internal AI tools and human-in-the-loop workflows.

---

## ✨ Overview

Modern AI systems depend on high-quality labeled data and human feedback.  
This project explores how lightweight internal tools can support:

- Dataset exploration  
- Data labeling workflows  
- Knowledge dashboards  
- Rapid AI interface prototyping  

Think of this as a **starter kit for building internal AI tooling.**
